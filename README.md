# Web-Scrapping-URLs-and-Perform-Text-Analysis
This was a an assignment that was assigned to me as a part of the selection process for BlackCoffer for their Data Science Internship. Broadly speaking, the task was to parse the 100 URLs
in the excel file (input.xlsx), extract only the titles and the main content from the articles and then perform text analysis on the extracted text, for exact details and how the metrics were to be calculated, refer 'objectives' and 'text analysis'. Before running file, refer the 'instructions' file to find out the dependencies and how I approached the problem along with
details on how to run the file. I learnt a great deal of things from this project and it was just too interesting to not post on my GitHub (show off?). Alright thanks for reading anyway :). Also if you are curious, I got rejected as I bombed the interview T-T.
